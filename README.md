# **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (Java)**

This project is a simple **Java-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game** designed for beginners to practice logic-building and develop programming skills. It operates entirely in the terminal and supports two-player gameplay. The winner is determined in a **best-of-3** format, with real-time feedback and scoring.

## **How to Play**
1. Run the program in the terminal.
2. Players take turns entering their choices:
   - `1` for Rock  
   - `2` for Paper  
   - `3` for Scissors  
3. The game announces the winner of each round and displays updated scores.  
4. The first player to win **2 rounds** out of 3 is declared the winner.

### **Rules**
- Rock beats Scissors.  
- Scissors beat Paper.  
- Paper beats Rock.  
- If both players make the same choice, the round is a draw.

## **Features**
